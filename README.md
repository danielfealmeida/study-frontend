# Studying App - Frontend

There has to be a file called `firebaseConfig.ts` on the `src` folder in this project. Create it and then write the following code on it:

```
const firebaseConfig:any = {
    apiKey: "API_KEY",
    authDomain: "AUTH_DOMAIN",
    projectId: "PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "SENDER_ID",
    appId: "APP_ID",
    measurementId: "MEASUREMENT_ID"
};

export default firebaseConfig
```

After that, substitute the placeholders with your own information and save the file.
